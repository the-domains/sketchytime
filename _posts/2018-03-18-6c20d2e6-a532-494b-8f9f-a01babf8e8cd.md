A rundown store off College Road was having a big sale

So Charlie wandered down there, the store man made him quail

A wizened man with green streaked hair and gnarly fingers too

Just the kind of person who could help him start anew

"I need a vacuum cleaner that's strong enough to suck

The heavy trash that's on my floor and rid me of the muck"

The store man seemed quite friendly and understood the trouble

Gave Charlie an appliance that could vacuum up his rubble

"If you need stronger suction" the store man said straight faced

"Give this knob a little twist, slowly not with haste"

The young man took his purchase home and started on the housework

His new toy got his carpets clean which made the young man smirk
