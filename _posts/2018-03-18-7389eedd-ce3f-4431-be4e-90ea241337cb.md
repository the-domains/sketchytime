**Dedicated to all parents**

The Greedy Vacuum Cleaner was written by Linda Grey-Wilson, one of 

many poems written during our children's growth. 

It has been mentioned that the characters depicted have a possible 

family resemblance, this has been firmly denied but we know better!

The illustrations were created on large blackboards using Pastels. The 

process requires some patience, an 8ftx4ft board, some blackboard 

paint and a finishing coat of Gessos and Grounds to help the Pastel 

adhere to the board. Once it's all dry you can paint with so much fun.
