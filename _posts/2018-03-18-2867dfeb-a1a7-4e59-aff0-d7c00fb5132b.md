His parents were perplexed when they entered Charlie's room

The place had never been so clean but felt more like a tomb

A vacuum cleaner stood alone upon the bedroom floor

A flyer for appliances was stuck upon the door

They never found their loving son, they never knew the story

They wondered why the room was void of Charlie's inventory

The house felt antiseptic without their loving son

An empty space now filled their home since their poor boy was gone
