It even cleaned scum from his bath, windows began to gleam

The walls took on a brighter hew, through magic it would seem

No smears upon the mirror, his reflection was quite clear 

The cruddy stains left on his sink were made to disappear

But still the room looked cluttered with bottles, cans and trash

Old papers lay upon the floor; a thought came in a flash

"If I turn the little knob the suction will improve

My messy room will be all clean, mum surely would approve"
